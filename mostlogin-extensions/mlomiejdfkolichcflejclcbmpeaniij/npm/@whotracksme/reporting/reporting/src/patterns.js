/**
* A list of predefined string transformations that can be specified
* in the DSL in the "transforms" definition.
*
* Notes:
* - All transformations are stateless and must be free of side-effects.
* - If a single steps return "null", the following steps will
*   not be executed.
* - The first argument is the current value (the accumulator),
*   but extra parameters can be defined in the DSL; these will be
*   passed to the function as additional arguments.
*
* Preventing remote code execution
* --------------------------------
*
* The predefined functions need to be carefully checked. To illustrate
* the threat model, let us look at a constructed example first:
*
*   badIdea: (x, param) => eval(param)
*
* Now, if an attacker compromises the servers and gets control to push
* malicious pattern updates, the function could be exploited:
*
* ["badIdea", "<some code that the client will execute>"].
*
* Be careful not to introduce a function that allows an attack
* like that. That is why it is so important to keep the function free
* of side-effects!
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Additional warnings:
*
* 1) Do not allow DoS (be careful when looping; if possible avoid any loops):
*
* As long as the functions are free of side-effects, the worst possible
* attack would be denial-of-service (in other words, someone could push a
* rule that results in an infinite loop). So, also be careful when using
* explicit loops - there should be no need for it anyway.
* Best keep the transformations simple.
*
* 2) Do not trust the parameters:
*
* Note that an attacker will be able to control the arguments passed
* into the function:
* - extra parameters are under direct control (as they are taken
*   from the rule definitions)
* - the first parameter (the accumulator) is more difficult to
*   control but expect that it is prudent to assume that it can
*   be controlled as well (e.g., if a user can be tricked to visit
*   any website where the attacker can control text)
*
* As long as you avoid side-effects and loops, critical exploits
* are not possible, but again there are DoS type attacks.
*
* For instance, if you are writing a rule with an parameter that will
* be used as a regular expression, be careful. What will happen if the
* attacker pushes a rule with a long regular expression that may lead
* to exponential backtracking? Think about these kind of attacks and
* about mitigations (e.g. reject overly long parameters).
* Again, it is best to keep the functions simple to avoid any surprises.
*
* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* Error handling:
*
* 1) Throwing an exception is supported. In that case, expect the whole
*    rule to be skipped (no message will be sent). In other words, reserve
*    it for unexpected cases.
* 2) Returning "null"/"undefined" has the semantic of stopping the
*    execution without an error. It is still possible that a
*    message will be sent, but with a missing value.
*
* After adding a new transformation, increase the API version (see PATTERN_DSL_VERSION).
